                      There are also such students in large quantity who pay no care and attention towards attending
                      schools or also don’t bother to make efforts in order to maintain their grades. It becomes much
                      frustrating to have such student in a class that only present there because they thought they
                      should
                      be present. These are those students who are not motivated in the start on their level of scores
                      and
                      when they wake up and starts realizing then they came to know that it is too late. So, it is the
                      duty of a teacher and administrator to motivate the students.

                      Researchers have conducted research and evaluated effects of self-esteem and academic
                      performance.
                      Many behavioral and educational problems arise due to low self-esteem. In educational
                      institutes,
                      different kinds of problems occur such as psychological and physical health problem. Self-esteem
                      has
                      become a major concern in organizations and educational institutions. Therapists, teachers, and
                      parents give attention towards students and help them to increase their confidence. So start
                      loving yourself because you are special.

                    <p class="card-text text-white">
                      Studies have examined the connection between depression and students’ academic performance.
                      There
                      is
                      a significant negative relationship between students’ performance and depression. Researchers
                      have
                      identified that different level of depression affects students’ grades. Moderate level of
                      depression
                      leads to low performance while normal depression does not have a negative effect on students’
                      grades. Results suggest that there is a need to take preventive measures so that depression
                      among
                      students can be reduced.

                      Most of the college students have the issues to manage money, as they are not able to manage the

                      in
                      this way cannot pay attention to studies because there is always the tension or the depression
                      created because of the money issues. Moreover, the student sometimes does not know that how to
                      set
                      the financial goals because they never knew the value of money or that the money is important in

                      future, they can make goal permanent.

                    Exercise has been found to stimulate the production of calming neurochemicals such as endorphins
                    and
                    reduces levels of cortisol (the “stress hormone”) burns away stress hormones. This is associated
                    with a reduction in anxiety symptoms. It is probably the single most important thing you can do to
                    fight anxiety.

                    <b>Tip 2:</b> Re-Learn Breathing
                    Most people don't realize this, but anxiety can actually alter the way you breathe. Those with
                    anxiety tend to take faster breaths, often taking in more oxygen than they need. This is called
                    "hyperventilation" and it's responsible for many of the physical symptoms of anxiety attacks.
                    <br>


                    You can re-train your body to breathe in a healthier way. It isn't easy but by spending 10 minutes
                    a
                    day breathing much more slowly, taking in full breaths deep into the abdomen can get your body
                    back
                    into better habits. Also, if you feel some of the symptoms of hyperventilation, slow down your
                    breathing to reduce the severity of those symptoms.

                    <b>Tip 3:</b> Avoid Over-thinking
                    Normally, when it comes to stress, some alone time can be very helpful. But for those with daily,
                    persistent anxiety, too much time alone with your own thoughts may cause problems of its own.
                    Remember that anxiety has the potential to alter thought patterns. So if you have anxiety, your
                    thoughts are more prone to being to being negative and fearful, often focusing on worst-case
                    scenarios or thoughts of lacking control. This can lead to further stress and anxiety.
                    <br>



                    If you tend to get stuck in anxious thinking, it can help to plan to keep your mind occupied. It’s
                    still important to have time to rest and relax, but scheduled activities (healthy activities, of
                    course - not partying, which we'll discuss in a bit) and commitments can provide a distraction
                    from
                    focusing on your anxieties, giving them less space to grow.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>Tip 4:</b> Avoid Crutches
                    We mentioned that you should avoid the partying lifestyle to prevent anxiety, and it's important
                    that you do your best to avoid crutches that could exacerbate your anxiety further.
                    <br>

                    A crutch is a strategy that reduces anxiety in the short-term. However, as soon as you stop using
                    that strategy, the anxiety returns. In this way, you don’t learn to cope in the long run. Drinking
                    alcohol and using recreational drugs can often reduce anxiety in the moment, but may mask the
                    underlying problem. They also have additional negative side-effects than can contribute to anxiety
                    themselves.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Even a seemingly “healthy” behavior could become a crutch if you rely on it too heavily and it
                    stops
                    you from learning to cope on your own. For example, always relying on a partner to relieve your
                    anxiety when going out may work, but doesn’t teach you how to manage anxiety if they’re not
                    around.

                    Precisely, when you love your job and do that with proper planning and happiness, you do smart
                    work
                    then.

                    A smart person has a clear idea of his works. First, he decides where to stop rather than what to
                    achieve.

                    It is an obvious fact that we are usually confused about smart work and hard work. Sometimes we

                    <h3>How to do smart work?</h3>
                    <br>

                    <b>1. Love What You Are Doing:</b>
                    <br>
                    Either love what you are doing or do what you love.

                    Happiness in your job is the most crucial part of your life. If you fail to love your job, you are
                    not a happy person anymore. The others could give you temporary happiness but you will be unable
                    to
                    be completely happy.

                    If you are not happy, your mind is always disturbed and in search of happiness. Now how a
                    disturbed
                    mind could think about planning and innovative ideas to enrich his business.

                    When your mind is confused and you are not happy, you could never do the smart work.

                    Precisely, firstly you have to love your job to work smart.

                    When you love language learning is it a burden for you then? But what if I impose upon you the
                    same.
                    You will be frustrated, isn’t it?

                    So, when you do not love language learning then how can you find different ways to learn the
                    language as fun?

                    On the other hand, when you love your career or job, you are happy and you progress more. You love
                    challenges then and your life becomes easy and happy.

                    So the first method is to love what you are doing. Sometimes it is hard to love our current jobs,
                    in
                    that case, you have to be daring to start a new one.

                    <b>2. Proper Planning:</b>

                    <br>
                    A great business idea could be a failure if it is not well planned and a small business could be a
                    giant if it is well planned.

                    Without the right planning and proper understanding, you will end up working hard. Great planning
                    and brilliant strategies can transform an ordinary business into extraordinary.

                    What is proper planning?
                    There is no such blueprint regarding proper planning. It is all about the clarity which you have
                    about your job. A complete idea about your business always leads to the right planning.

                    You need to know your to-do lists and not-to-do lists, your limitations, weaknesses and strong
                    points to give birth to the right planning and brilliant strategies.

                    What is the proper planning for a business or job?

                    To me, if you have clear answers to the following questions, your job or business is well planned
                    and you are doing smart work.
                    <br>


                    <b>The questions are:</b>
                    <br>

                    Why do you want to start your business?
                    How your company is beneficial to society?
                    What excites you? Is it money or the idea of creating something new and innovative?
                    Which are your weaknesses or strengths?
                    What if your company fail? Will you start a new one or will be depressed?
                    When your what and why are clear and you are doing something beneficial to society, you get the
                    energy to do it. You are happy then and you are doing the smart work.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>3. A Deep Desire for Learning.</b>
                    <br>

                    Your knowledge can only distinguish you from others. Your learning is the thing that makes you
                    extraordinary.

                    Without acquiring the right knowledge you can never enjoy the true happiness of success. A strong
                    desire for learning helps you to excel in anything. It makes you wise and confident.

                    When you can learn anything, you can do anything and you can be anything in life. When you learn
                    many things, you think differently and your mind opens up. An open mind can only see the
                    opportunities.

                    Knowledge of many things makes you different from the mass, you become confident and experienced.
                    You are smart then.

                    Learning means more information and more information means different thoughts; different thoughts
                    make you unique and smart.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>4. Think Outside the Box.</b>
                    <br>
                    Following the traditional path does not make you a smart person. When you do what everybody is
                    doing, you become the same and it is not a sign of a smart person.

                    Smart people create their paths and they open them for many. You will be unable to make the paths
                    for many if you follow someone.

                    Learn from everybody follow from none.

                    You need to think outside the box to be a smart guy. Without the out of the box thinking, you can
                    never face challenges, failures and sorrows which are crucial to being a great human being and the
                    best businessman also.

                    When you taste the failures, your success becomes tastier and your life becomes easy.

                    <b>1. Delegate Tasks</b>
                    <br>
                    It is common for all of us to take on more tasks than we are capable of completing. This can often
                    result in stress and burnout.

                    Delegation does not mean you are running away from your responsibilities but are instead learning
                    proper management of your tasks. Learn the art of delegating work to your subordinates as per
                    their
                    skills and abilities and get more done. This will not only free up time for you but will help your
                    team members feel like an integral piece of the work puzzle.

                    <b>2. Prioritize Work</b>
                    <br>
                    Before the start of the day, make a list of tasks that need your immediate attention. Unimportant
                    tasks can consume much of your precious time, and we tend to offer these too much of our energy
                    because they are easier or less stressful.
                    <br>

                    However, identifying urgent tasks that need to be completed on that day is critical to your
                    productivity. Once you know where to put your energy, you will start to get things done in an
                    order
                    that works for you and your schedule.
                    <br>

                    In short, prioritize your important tasks to keep yourself focused.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>3. Create a Schedule</b>
                    <br>
                    Carry a planner or notebook with you and list all the tasks that come to your mind. Being able to
                    check off items as you complete them will give you a sense of accomplishment and keep you
                    motivated.
                    <br>

                    Make a simple ‘To Do’ list before the start of the day, prioritize the tasks, and focus on the
                    essentials. Make sure that these tasks are attainable, too. If there is a big task you need to
                    complete, make that the only thing on your list. You can push the others to the next day.

                    To better manage your time management skills, you may think of making 3 lists: work, home and
                    personal.

                    <b>4. Set up Deadlines</b>
                    <br>
                    When you have a task at hand, set a realistic deadline and stick to it. Once you set a deadline,
                    it
                    may be helpful to write it on a sticky note and put it near your workspace. This will give you a
                    visual cue to keep you on task.

                    Try to set a deadline a few days before the task is due so that you can complete all those tasks
                    that may get in the way. Challenge yourself and meet the deadline; reward yourself for meeting a
                    difficult challenge.

                    required to speak publicly about your work. It is essential that you present yourself in the best

                    <ul>
                      <li>Get organized.</li>
                      <li>Practice your speech.</li>
                      <li>Visualize a positive outcome.</li>
                      <li>Get support.</li>
                      <li>Start small.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b>Get organized</b>
                    <br>
                    When you organize yourself, you are more likely to have a clear mind so you can better focus on
                    your
                    key points. Here are some ways to get organized:

                    Research your topic thoroughly.
                    Examine your target audience.
                    Create an outline and cue cards.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Practice your speech</b>
                    <br>

                    Your nervousness will dissipate when you practice and practice often. Before you write cue cards,
                    it
                    may be helpful to write a script and go over it a few times to memorize your key points. Here are
                    a
                    few ways you can practice:

                    Rehearse in front of a mirror.
                    Record yourself.
                    Give your speech in front of a friend or family member.
                    Once you complete any or all of these tasks, you can change your presentation accordingly.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>Visualize a positive outcome</b>
                    <br>
                    Think about what a positive outcome looks like, feels like and sounds like to you. Write down
                    these
                    outcomes and identify any probable alternative outcomes. Scratch a line through any outcome you
                    would not want to happen and circle the outcomes that you would like to happen. You may also
                    practice the audience reaction with an individual that listens to your speech before you give it
                    to
                    a large or small group.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>Get support</b>
                    <br>
                    It is easier to overcome fear when you have people to encourage you who have experienced the same
                    thing as you. Here are a few ways you can find support and encouragement in your community, as
                    well
                    as online:

                    Join a public speaking group.
                    Find a speech coach.
                    Watch videos of speeches.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Start small</b>
                    <br>
                    There are steps you can take to overcome your fear of public speaking and master the art of giving
                    speeches. Starting with small events will likely give you the confidence and expertise you need to
                    speak in front of a larger audience. Here are a few ways you can start small:

                    Deliver a speech to two or three people.
                    Give a toast at a friend’s wedding or other intimate event.
                    Volunteer to speak in front of a small audience, such as a small class or at a community center.

          </h3>
          <br>
          <p class="lead text-dark" style="font-family: 'verdana', sans-serif;">Procrastination is a challenge we have
            all faced at one point or another. For as long as humans have been
            around, we have been struggling with delaying, avoiding, and procrastinating on issues that are important
            to
            us.

            Now before starting let's throw some light on the word "Procrastination".
            Procrastination is the act of delaying or postponing a task or set of tasks. So, whether you refer
            to it
            as procrastination or akrasia(word by Aristotle) or something else, it is the force that deters
            you
            from
            following through on what you set out to do.
            <br>
            <br>


            "Time Inconsistency" is a phenomenon revealed by research called <b>"Behavioural psychology"</b> which
            helps
            explain why procrastination seems to pull us in despite our good intentions.
            <br>
            <b>Time inconsistency refers to the tendency of the human brain to value immediate rewards more
              highly
              than
              future rewards.</b>
            <br><br>

          After understanding the topic called <b>"Procrastination"</b> it's time to look into the ways of
          safeguarding
          yourself from this.
          <br><br>

          <b>The real game is of motivation and rewards</b>, These both are connected to each other as the graph
          of
          motivation sets out the rewards you gonna get in future and present.
          You cannot rely on long-term consequences and rewards to motivate the Present Self. Instead, you
          have
          to
          find a way to move future rewards and punishments into the present moment. You have to make the
          future
          consequences become present consequences.

          <br>
          <br>
          "It's better to do the task rather than thinking about it which causes <b>stress, Anxiety and much
            more</b>"<br>

          <b>The guilt, shame, and anxiety</b> that you feel while procrastinating are usually <b>worse than the
            effort
            and
            energy you have to put in while you're working.</b> The problem is not doing the work, it's starting
          the
          work.
          <br>

          If you can find a way to make the benefits of long-term choices more immediate, then it becomes
          easier
          to avoid procrastination. One of the best ways to bring future rewards into the present moment
          is
          with
          a
          strategy known as temptation bundling.
          <br><br>
          The basic format is: Only do <br><b>[THING YOU LOVE] <br>while doing [THING YOU PROCRASTINATE
            ON]</b><br><br>
          Here are a few common examples of temptation bundling:

          Only listen to audiobooks or podcasts you love while exercising, Get a pedicure while processing
          overdue
          work emails, Watch your favourite show while ironing or doing household chores.
          <br>
          <br>
          <p class="container fw-bold text-center">
            Follow the above-mentioned points and say bye-bye to procrastination!

          <p>
            <br>
            We often think a lot about ideas and strategies to achieve a goal, but sometimes we fail to accomplish
            it...
            why? The answer lies here:
            <br><br>
          <p class="fw-bold">The problem is not in the strategy, but in the
            determination to achieve the goal.</p><br>
          We tend to create schedules and routines that we rarely follow for more than a few days. The root cause is
          often "Dopamine".

          Whenever we engage in a pleasant activity, our brain releases a happy hormone called Dopamine.<br><br>

          <p>Engaging in highly enjoyable activities leads to an automatic
            increase in dopamine levels. If this pattern persists, it can lead to "Dopamine Intolerance."</p>
          Your brain becomes accustomed to higher dopamine levels and starts demanding activities that trigger
          significant dopamine release.

          The solution lies in a healthy activity that stimulates dopamine release:<br>
          <p class="fw-bold">Exercise.</p>
          Establishing an exercise routine may be challenging, but taking that initial step will pave the way for
          unstoppable progress towards your goals.

          <br>
          <p class="lead text-dark">Effective Communication : The power of asking<br>
          <p>Have you ever found yourself entangled in misunderstandings that have the potential to unravel even the
            strongest of relationships? At times, the simple solution is to "Just ask." The foundation of many
            relationships has crumbled due to misconceptions and misinterpretations. But by adhering to a seemingly
            simple rule — when something isn't clear, ask — you can dissolve confusion and foster meaningful progress.
          </p><br>

          <p>It's human nature to jump to conclusions or fill in gaps when things are unclear. However, this habit can
            lead to inaccuracies and unnecessary complications. Rather than making assumptions or relying on guesses,
            the act of asking can be the remedy. It's an act of humility and wisdom that goes a long way in building
            bridges of understanding.</p><br>

          <h4>The Art of Seeking Clarity</h4><br>

          <p>Imagine a scenario where a friend's behavior confuses you. Rather than letting your mind wander down a
            path of
            assumptions, take a moment to reach out. A simple, "I'm not sure I understand. Can you explain?" can work
            wonders. This straightforward approach not only clarifies the situation but also shows your commitment to
            open and honest communication.</p><br>

          <p>Effective communication isn't just about speaking; it's about listening, comprehending, and responding
            with
            sincerity. By seeking clarity, you pave the way for productive conversations, healthier relationships, and
            a more harmonious environment.</p><br>

          <h4>Breaking Down Barriers</h4><br>

          <p>Asking questions isn't a sign of weakness; it's a display of courage. It demonstrates your willingness to
            confront uncertainties head-on rather than allowing them to fester. This mindset extends beyond personal
            relationships and into the professional realm. In a workplace where assumptions can lead to costly
            mistakes,
            asking questions can save time, money, and reputation.</p><br>

          <p>Breaking down barriers through effective communication leads to improved collaboration and innovation.
            When
            people feel comfortable asking for clarification, new ideas can flourish, and problem-solving becomes more
            robust.</p><br>

          <h4>The Road to Resolution</h4><br>

          <p>In disputes or conflicts, asking the right questions can help you navigate the intricacies of the
            situation.
            Instead of assigning blame or making unfounded judgments, you're opening a dialogue that aims at
            understanding the root cause. This approach fosters empathy and facilitates finding a common ground for
            resolution.</p><br>

          <p>Remember, the choice to ask stems from a place of respect. It shows that you value the relationship
            enough to
            seek the truth rather than making hasty assumptions. So, the next time you find yourself in a puzzling
            situation, embrace the power of asking. You'll find that the path to clarity and connection is paved with
            questions.</p>

            <p>What is the Metaverse?
              The metaverse is a shared 3D virtual world in which you can socialize, collaborate, learn, and play.

              When discussing the metaverse, it is important to make a distinction between “a metaverse” and “The
              Metaverse.”

              The distinction has to do with control.

              A metaverse can be created by any organization whose goal is to create this 3D virtual
              environment/world.</p>
            <p style="font-family:serif">There has been a significant rise in searches for “metaverse” after
              Facebook’s
              Connect Keynote 2021
              presentation where Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, shared his vision of the metaverse, along with

            <p>
              Internet of Things (IoT) is the networking of physical objects that contain
              electronics embedded within
              their architecture in order to communicate and sense interactions amongst each other or with respect to
              the external environment or "IoT is network of interconnected computing devices which are embedded in
              everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data"</p>
            <p style="font-family:serif">One of the most interesting characteristics of IoT devices is that they are
              able to produce large amounts
              of data. This can be particularly used in applications such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine
              Learning.

              Most of IoT devices can produce in fact a great variety of Time Series data which are of huge interest
              in
              Artificial Intelligence....</p>

              Reality allows you to
              immerse yourself in the simulated world around you to interact with a virtual environment. Mixed Reality
              (MR) merges both real and virtual entities to produce new environments, where physical and digital

            <p style="font-family:serif">Mixed reality is usually a headset-based experience, similar to virtual
              reality. Alternatively, AR often
              comes from a flatscreen like a tablet or a smartphone. Mixed Reality experiences consider the geometry
              of
